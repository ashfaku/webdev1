        Turtles are ancient reptiles known for their protective shells and slow, deliberate movements. 
        Found in a variety of habitats, from freshwater ponds to tropical beaches, these resilient creatures have existed for over 200 million years. 
        With their long lifespans and unique ability to retract into their shells for defense, turtles are a popular exhibit in zoos and aquariums worldwide.
