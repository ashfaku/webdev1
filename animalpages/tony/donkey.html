    <p>
      The donkey is a domesticated member of the horse family, known for its resilience, intelligence, and strong work ethic. 
      Originating from Africa, donkeys have been used for transport and farming for thousands of years. 
      They are highly social animals with a distinctive bray and remarkable endurance.
