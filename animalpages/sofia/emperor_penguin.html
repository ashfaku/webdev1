    <h1>Emperor Penguin</h1>
    <img src="../../images/sofia/penguin.jpg" alt="Emperor Penguin">
    <p>The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all penguin species, known for its striking black and white plumage and vivid yellow and orange markings around the neck. Native to Antarctica, this species is especially adapted to its harsh environment, with a layer of densely packed feathers and a streamlined body for efficient swimming. Emperor penguins are renowned for their remarkable breeding behavior, where they endure the brutal winter on open ice to incubate their eggs, relying on their own body heat to survive and protect their young.</p>
