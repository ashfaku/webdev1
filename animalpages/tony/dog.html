    <p>
      The dog is one of the most loyal and intelligent domesticated animals, having been bred for companionship, work, and protection for thousands of years. 
      With an incredible sense of smell, sharp instincts, and diverse breeds suited for different environments, dogs play essential roles as service animals, herders, and family pets. 
      While not typically found in large zoo exhibits, dogs are often featured in educational programs and wildlife conservation efforts.
