    <p>The walrus is a large marine mammal known for its distinctive long tusks, whiskered face, and massive bulk. Primarily found in the Arctic Circle's cold waters, it is well adapted to the icy environment with its thick blubber and ability to slow its heartbeat to withstand freezing temperatures. Walruses are social creatures, often found lounging on icy shores in large groups, and they play a crucial role in Arctic marine ecosystems by consuming a large amount of seafood and thus influencing prey populations.</p>
