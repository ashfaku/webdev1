        Seals are marine mammals known for their streamlined bodies and layers of blubber 
        which keep them warm in frigid waters. They are adept swimmers, often seen gliding 
        gracefully through the ocean, yet they can also be found lounging on coastal shores 
        or ice floes. With a diet primarily consisting of fish, squid, and crustaceans, 
        seals play a crucial role in the marine food chain and maintaining the balance of 
        their ecosystems.
