    <p>Seals are marine mammals known for their streamlined bodies and layers of blubber which keep them warm in frigid waters. They are adept swimmers, often seen gliding gracefully through the ocean, yet they can also be found lounging on coastal shores or ice floes. With a diet primarily consisting of fish, squid, and crustaceans, seals play a crucial role in the marine food chain and maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.</p>
