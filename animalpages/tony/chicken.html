    <p>
      The chicken is a domesticated bird that has been bred for thousands of years for its eggs, meat, and companionship. 
      Originating from wild jungle fowl, chickens are social animals known for their distinct pecking order and varied vocalizations. 
      They are highly adaptable and can be found in farms, backyard coops, petting zoos, and restaurants around the world.
