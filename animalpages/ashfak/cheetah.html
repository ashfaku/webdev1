            Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 70 mph (113 km/h) 
            in short bursts while chasing prey. They are slender, long-legged big cats with a lightweight build, adapted 
            for speed rather than strength. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs do not have fully retractable claws, which 
            provides better grip while running. They primarily hunt small to medium-sized ungulates like gazelles and 
            impalas, relying on their incredible acceleration and keen eyesight to catch prey. Cheetahs are mostly solitary, 
            though mothers care for their cubs for about 18 months before they become independent. Found mainly in Africa, 
            with a small population in Iran, they face threats from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, 
            making them vulnerable to extinction.
