    <p>The orca, or killer whale, is a highly intelligent and versatile apex predator of the ocean, recognizable by its striking black and white coloring. Known for their complex social structures, orcas live in tightly knit family groups called pods, which exhibit unique vocal behaviors and hunting techniques passed down through generations. These magnificent marine mammals are found in all of the world's oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas, adapting to a wide variety of diets and habitats.</p>
